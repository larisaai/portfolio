                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> In week 38 we have learned some advanced HTML and CSS as Media Queries, breakpoints, HTML entities and many others. Using these new information and theory we needed to make our first website responsive(mobile version, tablet version and desktop version).</p>
                    <p> <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Because of the many mistakes I have made in the proccess of making first website I wasn't able to make it responsive and then after I tried some days to repair it in Brackets, in week 38 I have decided to make a new one, with a different structure and a more correct code.

                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>In order to prove our skills and knowlogde gained through Theme 1 we made some groups and each group had to redesign an existing website. </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> As a team we did some tests on our fellow students (the trunk test, five second test, expert review) we wrote a report with our conclusive results. This was our start point in redesigning a more appealing and interesting interface to the new website, easy to use by anyone and easy to understand what is everything about.</p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>After a lot of work we did again the tests ( the trunk test, five second test, expert review) and the answers were completely different in a good way. </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> To open the new website we need to use the following username and password:

                    </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Usename: keammd</p>

                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>As we started the Basic Animation Theme, we gained more advanced skills of Adobe Illustrator by making our first animation scene. We had to make a style tile, a storyboard, a character sheet, sprite-sheet and an analize with the narrative curve. Through this theme I learned to use Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> Now, when I am looking back at the beginning, I consider this project being pretty simple. But in the moment I did it was exciting for me. Everything starts with small steps and every beginning is difficult. </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>This animation made me think and also by doing my actors I learned almost everything in Adobe Illustrator, how to use and manage it. It was pretty interesting to use my imagination to create the characters, but also the story.

                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>In week 43 we were in groups ( around 5 people each group). We received the task to create our second interactive animation inspired by a fary-tale and ours was The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. We had to present it in a school from North of Copenhagen in front of teenagers(around 15 years old). We had to impress them because in the end they had the last word and they decided who was the best. I was pretty satisfied because we, as a team were the third one from 16 teams.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>In The Hunchback of Notre-Dame Animation I worked mostly with characters, scenes and backrgounds using Adobe Illustrator. Here I have improved my skills and I have learned more and more about Illustrator.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Being part of a team I understood better what means to be a good co-worker. We helped each othere and it made me to try more to give my help and also to learn more and more from all of us.

                        <span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> Theme 4 was the most challenging, because we had the longest project ( 4 weeks) and we had a lot to work to finish this project. </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>As the Digital Business Development Theme began we were divided into groups and needed to create an innovative business idea. We started brain storming and we had around 15 ideas and we have decided to choose to begin a startup company ViewFinder. The company offers a tourist guiding and photography service to visitors of Copenhagen. </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Our Mission statement: We help visitors of Copenhagen to get a great experience of the city and capture ever lasting memories of their trip while giving the upper coming photography enthusiasts and local tour guides an opportunity to sharpen their photography skills, earn a few extra crowns, and build rewarding international friendships.</p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> Chosen vision statement: Become the Airbnb of photography tours.</p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Values: Trust, Passion, Friendship, Simplicity, Flexibility</p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>Trevellers and visitors of Copenhagen, young and middle age, traveling on budget, solo or couples who want good quality photographs. We did a research about this and we concluded that our target group needs our service and when we discussed about it I remembered that last year when I was here to visit my brother it could have been nice to have good pictures in a good price.</p>

                    <a href="https://fronter.com/kea/links/files.phtml/1186360019$431753663$/1.+Semester/D.+Theme+04_prcent_3A+Basic+UX/04.02_prcent_3A+Business_prcent_2C+Users+_prcent_26+Communication/Submissions/04.02.02_prcent_3A+Report/Final+Report+ViewFinder.pdf">

                    </a>

                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>What was most surprising for me was that we did a lot of research. I have never imagined that we need to search that much information and that many different things that we needed to know. We did a lot of research to find a good name for our sevice, also to find our competitors and even about the budgets we needed.

                    </p>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span>It was pretty difficult to choose the colours for our app and our website, but we tried to make a connection between colours and our target group. It was also pretty difficult to choose best logo because we wanted something that fits on mobile version and to be easy to see and recognise. </p>

                    <a href="https://fronter.com/kea/links/files.phtml/1186360019$265008519$/1.+Semester/D.+Theme+04_prcent_3A+Basic+UX/04.00_prcent_3A+Late+submissions/Design_Documentation_final.pdf">

                    </a>
                    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em"></span> Here I did also some sketches for the app and the website, I did a lot of research for what we need as resources, channels of becoming known, partners and costs for our service and all our resources. Was interesting to play with design and to try to create something simple, but interesting. I didn't do the last version of our service, but I think I helped as much as I could.
